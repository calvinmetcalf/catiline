A JavaScript library all about workers. Workers should make your life easier not harder and with communistjs launching a new worker is as simple as calling a function, and it works the same across all (modern) browsers.

How easy? `var worker = cw(myFunc)` creates a worker, send it data with `var response = worker.data(YOUR DATA);`, response is a [promise](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/11/asynchronous-programming-in-javascript-with-promises.aspx). It's that easy, read bellow for the full API and examples.

Want to use it? Grab the [development version](https://raw.github.com/calvinmetcalf/communist/master/dist/communist.js) or [production version](https://raw.github.com/calvinmetcalf/communist/master/dist/communist.min.js) from the dist folder. 

For usage checkout the <a id='api' href='API.md'>API page</a>, or browse a few demos:

__Important:__ you're going to want to it yourself, on the same domain as your page, if you can't or need to bundle it  and still want it to work on IE10, Opera, and Safari. You need to host the file "SHIM_WORKER.js" on the same domain as the html file 
and set the path to it in a global variable `SHIM_WORKER_PATH` before you load this script.
